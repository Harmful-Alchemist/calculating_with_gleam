# calc

A quick Gleam weekend project that is a very basic calculator. The Pratt parsing is copied from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/compiling-expressions.html).
The execution basis is from [Programming in Haskell](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html). Everything that's not so good is mine ðŸ˜€.

## Quick start

```sh
gleam test  # Run the tests
gleam shell # Run an Erlang shell
```

In the shell run such exiting commands as:

```
calc:run("1+1").
```
